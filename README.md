## Overview

An experiment in visualizing a year's worth of TED Talk view data using
[p5.js](http://p5js.org).

If you are TED staff, contact me for a data set to use. Anyone else? I can
provide a set of dummy data if you just want to see how this looks.

## Usage

  - `bower install`
  - `ruby server.rb`
  - Browse to http://localhost:8000/
